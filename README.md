# StorageTool
This is a tool to store generic folders in different folders by creating ntfs junctions at the original location and moving the specified folder to the new location.
You can define multiple profiles for different location-pairs you want to use.
Very handy to stash your Steamgames on a different harddrive. ;) (Or Origin/GoG/Generic)

Thanks go out to SteamTool at http://www.stefanjones.ca/steam/ for the inspiration and to Jeff Brown's .NET Junction Library at http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/15633/Manipulating-NTFS-Junction-Points-in-NET.

You probably need .NET Framework 4 (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49981)
