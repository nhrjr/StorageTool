# StorageTool
This is a tool to store generic folders in different folders by creating ntfs junctions at the original location and move the specified folder to a new location.
Think about Steam/Origin/GoG installed Games, which you want to store on a different harddrive.
You can define profiles for different Game <-> Storage locations.
